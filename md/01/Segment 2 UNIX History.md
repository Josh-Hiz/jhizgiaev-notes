# UNIX History

- Originally developed in 1969 at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
- In 1973, it was rewritten in C. This made it portable and changed the history of operating systems
- In 1975, Thompson, Joy, Haley, and students at Berkeley develop the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) of UNIX
- Two main directions emerge, BSD and what was to become "System V"
