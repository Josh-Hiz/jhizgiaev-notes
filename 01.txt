Lecture 01
==========

Before class:
-------------
- I read the course website and syllabus.
- I watched all course lecture videos for week 01, 
  segment 1 Introduction, segment 2 UNIX History, 
  and segment 3 UNIX basics.
- I took markdown notes for each video available in the `md/` folder in this git repo

- To practice my C, I wrote another version of simple shell,
  simple-shell3.c, that now has a tokenizer that allows users to now
  execute programs with a variable number of parameters (I.e "ls -a", "cat test.txt", etc)

- I aliased the "cc" command and created a CFLAGS environment variable
  within my NetBSD VM. Now "cc" will execute "cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra

- Open questions:

  1. Will we be using Makefiles in class for exercises and homework?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- always use the right compiler flags ('-Wall -Wextra -Werror'), as that's how we will be graded
- Makefiles will be used for some homework assignments, and group projects
- I need to run and understand the long pipe'd command shown in class
